For each function there is a train.csv and a test.csv

Titles of csv will be based off of what function it is performing it on e.g.
LQ80_train.csv and LQ80_test.csv

Each csv will have id column and column of outputs

each id will look like [id]_train_0 <- the id here will be replaced with actual id
